DESCRIPTION

Like many other companies, my company provides VPN access to its employees 
so that we can stay connected from our home offices or on the road. Most 
of the time, I connect to the company network through a web portal which 
downloads, installs and runs Juniper's "Network Connect" software on the 
Windows client system. That's all fine and dandy, except that I am a 
command-line guy and find it way too clumsy to fire up a web browser just 
in order to "dial in".

Fortunately, Juniper's Network Connect client has a command-line interface, 
and so here is a trivial DOS batch script which can be used to establish a 
connection in "I-don't-need-no-stinkin'-buttons" mode.

The script assumes that the Network Connect client has been installed and 
run in the usual manner (i.e. from the web portal) at least once. It will 
attempt to auto-detect the VPN host and user name, so in most cases all 
you have to specify is password information. Oh, and the script assumes 
you want to connect to the "SecurID(Network Connect)" realm by default, which 
requires entering a PIN and a number displayed on your RSA SecurID token.
